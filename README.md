# Puzzle Solver

This project is a collection of Java programs designed to solve classic puzzles efficiently using **graph-based data structures** and **heuristic search algorithms**.

## Features

- **Rubikâ€™s Cube (2x2x2)** solver  
- **Sudoku** solver  
- **Connect 4** AI opponent  
- **UpItUp** puzzle solver  

Each solver is built to work **optimally**, finding the shortest or most efficient solution.

## Key Highlights

- Utilizes **graph representations** of puzzle states
- Implements **BFS**, **DFS**, **A\***, and other heuristic-based search algorithms
- Demonstrates **algorithm design**, **problem solving**, and **efficient coding practices**
- Well-structured Java code for easy extension and maintenance
